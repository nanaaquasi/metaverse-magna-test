### Install and running the project

Installing and running the project is as simple as running

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

- Note that I recommend using yarn.

This runs the `dev` script specified in our `package.json`, and will spawn off a vite server which reloads the page as we save our files.
Typically the server should be automatically opened for you.

```

```
